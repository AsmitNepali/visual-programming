## Introduction to C# .NET.

### What is C# ?

C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".

It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.

The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 10.0, was released in September 2019.

### C# is used for:

- Mobile applications
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web services
- Web Sites
- Games
- VR
- Database applications
- And much, much more!

### Why Use C#?

- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.
- It is easy to learn and simple to use.
- It has a huge community support.
- C# is an object-oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering
  development costs.
- As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa.

### Development of C# .Net

History of C# language is interesting to know. Here we are going to discuss brief history of C# language.

C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp". It is an object-oriented programming language provided by Microsoft that runs on .Net
Framework.

Anders Hejlsberg is known as the founder of C# language.

It is based on __C++ and Java__, but it has many additional extensions used to perform component oriented programming
approach.

C# has evolved much since their first release in the year **2002**. It was introduced with __.NET Framework 1.0__ and
the current version of C# is __10.0 (Until This Note Is Prepare)__.

#### What is use of CLR?

> *The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is programming that manages the execution of programs written in any of several
supported languages, allowing them to share common object-oriented classes written in any of the languages. It is a part
of Microsoftâ€™s. NET Framework.*

### Introduction to C# .net & it's features.

***
![alt-text](https://static.javatpoint.com/csharp/images/csharp-features1.png)

#### 1. Simple

C# is a simple language in the sense that it provides structured approach (to break the problem into parts), rich set of
library functions, data types etc.

#### 2. Modern Programming Language

C# programming is based upon the current trend, and it is very powerful and simple for building scalable, interoperable
and robust applications.

#### 3. Object Oriented

C# is object-oriented programming language. OOPs, makes development and maintenance easier whereas in Procedure-oriented
programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grow.

#### 4. Type Safe

C# type safe code can only access the memory location that it has permission to execute. Therefore, it improves a
security of the program.

#### 5. Interoperability

Interoperability process enables the C# programs to do almost anything that a native C++ application can do.

#### 6. Scalable and Updatable

C# is automatic scalable and updatable programming language. For updating our application we delete the old files and
update them with new ones.

#### 7. Component Oriented

C# is component oriented programming language. It is the predominant software development methodology used to develop
more robust and highly scalable applications.

#### 8. Structured Programming Language

C# is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is
easy to understand and modify.

#### 9. Rich Library

C# provides a lot of inbuilt functions that makes the development fast.

#### 10. Fast Speed

The compilation and execution time of C# language is fast.

### Basic structure of C# .Net

A C# program consists of the following parts:

* Namespace declaration
* A class
* Class methods
* Class attributes
* A Main method
* Statements and Expressions
* Comments

##### Program.cs

```
    using System;
    
    namespace HelloWorld
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    
            }
        }
    }
```

#### Line 1: 
``` using System``` means that we can use classes from the ```System``` namespace.

#### Line 2: 
A blank line. C# ignores white space. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.

#### Line 3:
```namespace``` is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.

#### Line 4: 
The curly braces ```{}``` marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

#### Line 5:
```class``` is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program. Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Program.

#### Line 7:
Another thing that always appear in a C# program, is the Main method. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed. You don't have to understand the keywords before and after ```Main```. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.


#### Line 9:
The next line ```/*...*/``` is ignored by the compiler and it is put to add __comments__ in the program.

#### Line 10:
```Console``` is a class of the ```System``` namespace, which has a ```WriteLine()``` method that is used to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World!".

If you omit the ```using System line```, you would have to write ```System.Console.WriteLine()``` to print/output text.

> *__Note:__ Every C# statement ends with a semicolon ```;```.*

> *__Note:__ C# is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.*

> *__Note:__ Unlike Java, the name of the C# file does not have to match the class name, but they often do (for better organization). When saving the file, save it using a proper name and add ".cs" to the end of the filename. To run the example above on your computer, make sure that C# is properly installed: Go to the Get Started Chapter for how to install C#. The output should be:*
