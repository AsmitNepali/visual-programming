### What is C# ?
___
C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".  

It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.  

C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.  

The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 10.0, was released in September 2019.

### C# is used for:
___
- Mobile applications
- Desktop applications 
- Web applications 
- Web services 
- Web Sites 
- Games 
- VR 
- Database applications 
- And much, much more!

### Why Use C#?
___
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world. 
- It is easy to learn and simple to use.
- It has a huge community support.
- C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
- As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa.  

### Development of C# .Net
___
History of C# language is interesting to know. Here we are going to discuss brief history of C# language.  

C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp". It is an object-oriented programming language provided by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework.  

Anders Hejlsberg is known as the founder of C# language.  

It is based on __C++ and Java__, but it has many additional extensions used to perform component oriented programming approach.  

C# has evolved much since their first release in the year **2002**. It was introduced with __.NET Framework 1.0__ and the current version of C# is __10.0 (Until This Note Is Prepare)__.

#### What is use of CLR?
> *The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is programming that manages the execution of programs written in any of several supported languages, allowing them to share common object-oriented classes written in any of the languages. It is a part of Microsoftâ€™s. NET Framework.*

### Introduction to C# .net & it's features.
***
![alt-text](https://static.javatpoint.com/csharp/images/csharp-features1.png)
#### 1. Simple
C# is a simple language in the sense that it provides structured approach (to break the problem into parts), rich set of library functions, data types etc.

#### 2. Modern Programming Language
C# programming is based upon the current trend, and it is very powerful and simple for building scalable, interoperable and robust applications.

#### 3. Object Oriented
C# is object-oriented programming language. OOPs, makes development and maintenance easier whereas in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grow.

#### 4. Type Safe
C# type safe code can only access the memory location that it has permission to execute. Therefore, it improves a security of the program.

#### 5. Interoperability
Interoperability process enables the C# programs to do almost anything that a native C++ application can do.

#### 6. Scalable and Updatable
C# is automatic scalable and updatable programming language. For updating our application we delete the old files and update them with new ones. 

#### 7. Component Oriented
C# is component oriented programming language. It is the predominant software development methodology used to develop more robust and highly scalable applications.

#### 8. Structured Programming Language
C# is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.

#### 9. Rich Library
C# provides a lot of inbuilt functions that makes the development fast.

#### 10. Fast Speed
The compilation and execution time of C# language is fast.
